# Image Classification on Tiny Dataset

This project is a basic image classification pipeline built using a small custom dataset. The goal is to understand the fundamental steps in building and training an image classifier using Python and machine learning libraries.

## üìå Project Goals

- Load and preprocess a tiny image dataset
- Train a basic image classifier using a deep learning model (e.g., CNN with TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch)
- Evaluate performance and visualize results
- Learn best practices for data loading and model training

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset consists of images resized to 64x64 pixels, organized in labeled folders. It is small enough to allow fast experimentation.

> Note: The dataset is not included in this repository. Please provide your own dataset or request access.
